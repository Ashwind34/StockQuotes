# StockQuotes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Overview

This application provides real-tme stock quote information.  Users can obtain real time stock quotes.  Users can also register with the service.  Once they are registered, users can create a personalized favorites list.  Registered users can add or remove favorites from their list and quickly bring up quotes.

This application uses a back-end application built on Loopback 3, an Express.js framework.  The repo also includes a simple Express.js server file for deployment once a build has been created.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
